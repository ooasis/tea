**Green tea** is defined by what *doesn't* happen: the leaves are **not oxidized**. Shortly after picking, they’re heated to “kill the green” (*shāqīng*), stopping enzymatic browning and locking in springlike aromatics—fresh grass, chestnut, sweet beans, and tender vegetables.

### How it’s made (in one breath)

- **Pluck** (usually bud + 1 leaf, or bud + 2 leaves)
- **Fixation** (*shāqīng*) by pan-firing or steaming
- **Shaping** (rolling, pressing, twisting, flattening)
- **Drying** to stabilize the tea

### Seasonal grading you’ll hear a lot

- **Míngqián (明前)**: picked before Qingming; sweetest, most delicate, most prized
- **Yǔqián (雨前)**: picked after Qingming/before Grain Rain; fuller, more robust
