**Yellow tea** starts like Green tea, but adds a rare, craft-heavy step called **sealed yellowing** (*mèn huáng*). The result is a cup that’s gentler and rounder than most Green tea, with fewer sharp “grassy” edges and more grain, orchid, and sweet corn notes.

### The defining step: *Mèn Huáng* (闷黄)

After fixation, warm leaves are **wrapped and rested** so they lightly transform in their own warmth and moisture. Timing is everything: too short and it stays green-ish; too long and it can taste dull or stale.

### Why it’s rare

- **Labor intensive** and hard to scale
- **High risk** of spoilage if humidity/temperature drift
- **Small demand** compared to Green/Oolong/Red categories

### Famous varieties & origins

- **Junshan Yinzhen** — Junshan Island, Hunan
- **Mengding Huangya** — Mengding Mountain, Sichuan
- **Huoshan Huangya** — Huoshan County, Anhui
- **Dading Liuan Huangya** — Liuan, Anhui
