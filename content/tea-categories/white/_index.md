**White tea** is the most minimalist major category: typically **wither → dry**, with no pan-firing and little-to-no intentional shaping. That gentle handling preserves bud hairs and high aromatic clarity—soft florals, melon, hay, and a cooling sweetness.

### What “white tea” really means

White tea isn’t “white” because of liquor color; it’s named for the **silvery bud down** (*háo*) and the style’s light touch. The main skill is controlling **wither** (time, airflow, humidity) so the leaf slowly transforms without going stale.

### Common grades (by picking standard)

- **Bái Háo Yínzhēn (Silver Needle)**: buds only
- **Bái Mǔdān (White Peony)**: bud + leaves
- **Gōng Méi / Shòu Méi**: larger leaf sets; deeper fruit/wood tones

### Aging

White tea is famously age-friendly: bright florals can shift toward **dried fruit, honeyed herbs, and medicinal notes** over years.

### Famous varieties & origins
