In Chinese classification, what the West calls “black tea” is **Red tea** (*hóng chá*), named for the **reddish-amber liquor**. It is **fully oxidized**, transforming fresh leaf into flavors that often read as malt, cocoa, honey, dried fruit, and warm spice.

### The classic processing arc

- **Wither** to reduce moisture and increase pliability
- **Roll / shape** to bruise the leaf and expose enzymes
- **Oxidize** until aroma and color peak
- **Dry** to lock in the profile

### What quality often emphasizes

- **Golden buds** (*jīn háo*): sweetness and silky texture
- **Clean oxidation**: fragrant rather than “stewed”
- **Balanced strength**: depth without harsh briskness

### Famous varieties & origins

- **Qimen Hongcha (Keemun)** — Qimen County, Anhui
