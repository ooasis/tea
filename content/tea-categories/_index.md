The foundation of all Chinese tea knowledge begins with understanding the **Six Major Categories**. While it is a common misconception that different teas come from different plants, almost all authentic Chinese tea originates from a single species: *Camellia sinensis*. The incredible diversity we enjoy—from the grassy sweetness of a spring Green tea to the earthy depth of an aged Pu-erh—is determined by the artisanal processing of the leaf, specifically the level of oxidation and fermentation.

## 1. Green Tea (Lǜ Chá | 绿茶)

**The Essence of Spring**

{{< img src="green.png" w="200x" alt="Green Tea" class="float-image" >}}

Green tea is often considered the oldest and most popular category in China, representing the "fresh leaf" in its purest form. It is non-oxidized; the leaves are heated shortly after picking to "kill the green" (*shāqīng*), which stops the natural enzymatic breakdown. This preserves the vibrant green color and the fresh, vegetal aroma that defines the category. Historically, green tea is documented since at least the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD), where it was a primary form of "tribute tea" sent to the Imperial Court.

Quality in Green tea is often defined by the "tenderness" of the pluck. The most prestigious grade is **Mingqian**, referring to tea picked before the Qingming Festival in early April, when the buds are at their sweetest. As the season progresses into **Yuqian** (before the Grain Rain), the leaves become larger and the flavor profile becomes more robust and slightly more astringent.

## 2. White Tea (Bái Chá | 白茶)

**The Unspoiled Leaf**

{{< img src="white.png" w="200x" alt="White Tea" class="float-image" >}}

White tea is defined by its elegant simplicity. It undergoes the least amount of processing of any category, consisting only of withering and drying. Because the leaves are not pan-fired, rolled, or intentionally oxidized, they retain the silvery-white "down" (fine hairs) on the buds, resulting in a tea that is exceptionally high in amino acids and floral in character. This category was originally a specialty of Fujian province, and ancient records suggest it was used for its medicinal cooling properties long before it became a daily beverage.

The grading of White tea is uniquely strict and is based entirely on the picking standard. The younger the pluck, the higher the grade. White tea is also one of the few categories meant for aging; as it sits for years, the floral notes transform into deep aromas of dried dates and medicinal herbs.

## 3. Yellow Tea (Huáng Chá | 黄茶)

**The Imperial Rarity**

{{< img src="yellow.png" w="200x" alt="Yellow Tea" class="float-image" >}}

Yellow tea is a rare gem in the tea world, sharing a similar starting point with Green tea but including a unique, labor-intensive step called *Mèn Huáng* (Sealed Yellowing). After being heated, the warm, damp leaves are wrapped in paper or cloth to lightly oxidize in their own steam. This process removes the "grassy" sharpness found in Green tea, creating a mellow, smooth, and golden infusion that is incredibly gentle on the palate. Historically, Yellow tea was once reserved exclusively for the Emperor.

Because the "yellowing" process requires a master's touch to prevent the leaves from spoiling or turning "stale," it is increasingly rare in the modern market. It is often graded by the size and uniformity of the buds, with the needle-shaped varieties representing the highest artisanal achievement.

## 4. Oolong Tea (Wūlóng Chá | 乌龙茶)

**The Artisan’s Masterpiece**

{{< img src="oolong.png" w="200x" alt="Oolong Tea" class="float-image" >}}

Oolong is often called the "Artisan’s Tea" because it is partially oxidized (anywhere from 20% to 80%) and requires complex processing. It involves repeated bruising, shaking, withering, and often charcoal roasting to coax out specific aromatic compounds. This results in an incredibly broad spectrum of flavors, ranging from light and floral to dark, stony, and fruity. Oolong is commonly associated with the late Ming / early Qing era in Fujian (especially the Wuyi region) and later became closely associated with *Gongfu Cha* brewing culture.

Grading in Oolong is multifaceted, focusing on the altitude of the garden (High Mountain vs. Lowland), the level of charcoal roasting, and the specific cultivar of the tea bush. Each variety listed below carries a distinct "rock rhyme" (*yán yùn*) or floral fragrance that defines its quality.

## 5. Red Tea (Hóng Chá | 红茶)

**The Golden Nectar**

{{< img src="red.png" w="200x" alt="Red Tea" class="float-image" >}}

What the West calls Black tea is known in China as **Red Tea** (*Hóng Chá*), named after the reddish-amber color of the brewed liquid. It is fully oxidized, a process that turns the leaves dark and transforms their chemical makeup to produce robust flavors of malt, chocolate, and dark fruit. The history of black/red tea is often traced to early Wuyi styles such as **Lapsang Souchong**, which is frequently cited as one of the earliest black teas and is traditionally smoked over pine wood to help it store and travel.

Grading in the Chinese Red Tea tradition emphasizes the presence of golden buds. The highest tiers consist almost entirely of tiny, golden-tipped buds which provide a silky texture and natural honey sweetness, whereas lower grades include more mature leaves and offer a more astringent, "brisk" cup.

## 6. Black Tea (Hēi Chá | 黑茶)

**The Living Tea**

{{< img src="black.png" w="200x" alt="Black Tea" class="float-image" >}}

Black tea is the category most associated with post-fermentation (microbial activity during processing and/or storage). Unlike other teas, Black tea—the most famous of which is **Pu-erh**—is often described as a "living" product that can continue to evolve with age. It was historically produced for trade with Tibet and Mongolia along the "Tea Horse Road," where long journeys and humid conditions could encourage fermentation in compressed tea. This fermentation creates deep, earthy, and woody flavors that are often compared to a damp forest floor or sweet beetroots.

The grading of Dark tea is unique; while leaf size matters, the most important factors are the age of the tea and the age of the trees. **Gushu** (Ancient Tree) tea is the highest grade, prized for its complex mouthfeel and "tea energy" (*Cha Qi*). Dark tea is also divided into **Sheng** (Raw), which ages naturally, and **Shu** (Ripe), which undergoes an accelerated fermentation process.
