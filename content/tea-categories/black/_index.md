In Chinese taxonomy, **Black tea** (*hēi chá*, often translated as “dark tea”) is defined by **microbial fermentation**. This is the family that includes **Pu-erh** and other post-fermented teas that can continue to evolve over months and years, developing earthy, woody, camphor-like, or sweet root-cellar depth.

### What makes it different

Unlike simple oxidation, **fermentation involves microbes** reshaping the tea’s chemistry. Historically, compression and long-distance trade (and the humidity encountered along the way) helped drive these transformations.

### Pu-erh basics (Yunnan)

- **Shēng (Raw)**: naturally aging over time; can be bright and bitter when young, complex and sweet when mature
- **Shú (Ripe)**: accelerated fermentation (*wòduī*) for an immediately deep, mellow profile

### Quality factors people care about

- **Age** (for many styles)
- **Leaf material** and **tree age** (e.g., *gǔshù* “ancient tree”)
- **Storage** (clean, stable humidity; no off odors)

### Famous varieties & origins
