### Comparison Notes for Buyers:

* **Yunnan Sourcing (US vs. China):** Make sure you use the **.us** link if you want domestic shipping from within the United States. Their **.com** site ships from China and has a larger selection but takes longer to arrive.
* **Red Blossom (San Francisco):** They are a premier US-based importer. While their prices are higher, their quality control and customer service are tailored for the American market.
* **TeaVivre:** They frequently offer the best "bulk" deals and a very high volume of fresh-harvest green teas (like Longjing) every spring.
* **White2Tea:** Though they ship from China, they are arguably the most "popular" brand for the modern Gongfu tea community in the US due to their unique branding and exclusive tea pressings.
