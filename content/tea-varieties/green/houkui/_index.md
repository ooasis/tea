## The History: The "Monkey King" of Green Tea

Taiping Houkui is one of China's most visually stunning and prestigious green teas. It was first created in the late 19th century in Taiping County (now Huangshan District) of Anhui Province.

The name "Houkui" is a combination of **"Hou"** (Monkey) from Houkeng village, and **"Kui"** (Leader/Chief), signifying its status as the "King" of teas. Legend says a farmer noticed a wild tea bush growing on a cliffside so steep only monkeys could reach it. He managed to get seeds from it and created this majestic tea. In 1915, it won the gold medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, alongside Keemun and Maofeng.

## Geography: The Mists of Houkeng

Taiping Houkui is grown in a very small, specific area near **Taiping Lake** at the foot of the Yellow Mountain (Huangshan).

*   **Terroir:** The best tea comes from **Houkeng Village**. The high altitude (700m+), cool mist from the lake, and nutrient-rich soil create a unique environment.
*   **The Unique Processing:** Unlike other teas that are rolled, Taiping Houkui leaves are **pressed flat** between two layers of mesh cloth and dried. This preserves the leaf's natural size (sometimes up to 10cm long!) and prevents it from curling.

## Decoding the Grades

Taiping Houkui is graded by its "form" and its source. Because the production process is entirely by hand and extremely slow, true Houkeng tea is very rare.

### 1. Sourcing
*   **Houkeng (Core Area):** The "Champagne" of Houkui. It has a distinctive orchid fragrance and a sweet "mountain charm."
*   **Hougang & Yanjiachun:** High-quality areas surrounding the core village.

### 2. Picking Standard
*   **Special Grade:** One bud with two leaves, perfectly flat, straight, and uniform. The leaves should "sandwich" the bud, creating a "two knives and one pole" appearance.

## How to Identify Quality

True Taiping Houkui is famous for its **"Green Body and Red Vein."**

| **Liquor** | Clear, bright yellowish-green. | Dull yellow or cloudy. |

*   **International-Friendly Online Shops:**
    *   **Seven Cups:** One of the few Western vendors with a direct relationship with the Houkeng village masters.

Taiping Houkui is a "gentle giant." Despite its large size, it is incredibly delicate. For the best visual experience, brew it in a **tall glass** with 80°C water. Watch as the long leaves stand upright like a forest in the water—a sight as beautiful as the taste.
