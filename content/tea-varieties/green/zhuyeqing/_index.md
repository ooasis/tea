## The Culture: The Zen Tea of Mount Emei

Zhu Ye Qing is a modern classic of Chinese green tea, originating from the sacred **Mount Emei** in Sichuan Province, one of the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China.

The tea was given its poetic name in 1964 by Foreign Minister Chen Yi, who was impressed by the tea's resemblance to fresh **green bamboo leaves**. In the cup, the buds stand upright, echoing the verticality of the bamboo forests and the spiritual "Zen" (Chan) culture of the Emei temples. It is a tea that emphasizes aesthetics, purity, and a quiet, contemplative energy.

## Geography: The Mists of the Sacred Peak

The terroir of Zhu Ye Qing is defined by the high-altitude, misty environment of Mount Emei (800–1,200 meters).

*   **Terroir:** Mount Emei is famous for its "Sea of Clouds" and extremely high humidity. The tea gardens are often hidden in the mist, which naturally shades the tea bushes. This leads to a higher concentration of amino acids (sweetness) and a lower concentration of polyphenols (bitterness).
*   **Volcanic Soil:** The soil on Emei is rich in minerals and volcanic elements, which gives the tea a clean, "crisp" finish that is distinct from the more "nutty" green teas of Eastern China.

## Decoding the Grades

Zhu Ye Qing is a "Single Bud" tea. The grading is strictly controlled by the official brand that holds the trademark.

### 1. The Official Grading System
*   **Lun Dao (Supreme):** The highest grade. Made from the very first, most uniform buds of spring. It is exceptionally sweet and visually perfect.
*   **Jing Xin (Classic):** High-quality buds with a more robust flavor profile.
*   **Yi Pin (Premium):** The standard grade, great for daily drinking.

### 2. Harvest Timing
True Zhu Ye Qing is always **Pre-Qingming** (harvested before April 5th). Because it grows in the warmer climate of Sichuan, it is often one of the first green teas to hit the market each spring, sometimes as early as February or March.

## How to Identify Quality

Zhu Ye Qing is all about "Verticality" and "Clarity."

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Uniform, plump, flat-sided buds; vibrant emerald green. | Broken, thin, or yellowish buds; presence of leaves. |
| **The "Zen" View** | When brewed in a glass, the buds should stand perfectly upright at the bottom. | The buds float horizontally or clump together. |
| **Aroma** | Freshly cut grass, roasted beans, and a delicate floral "mist." | Flat, musty, or overly nutty. |
| **Taste** | Crisp, sweet, with a "cooling" sensation and no bitterness. | Thin, watery, or harshly astringent. |
