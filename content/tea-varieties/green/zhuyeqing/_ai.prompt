An artistic illustration for the tea page “Zhu Ye Qing (Green Bamboo Reed - 竹叶青)”: layered mountain terraces in morning mist, minimal serene composition; a clear glass cup nearby with luminous, crystal-clear liquor; subtle calligraphy-style label with the tea name (English only, no logos); wet-on-wet ink wash textures with restrained color accents and soft paper grain; include a close foreground of the dry leaf shape and a translucent cup showing the liquor color; premium, calm, museum-poster feel, high quality digital art.
