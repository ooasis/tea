Aspect Ratio: 16:9
An artistic illustration celebrating the uniqueness of Anji Bai Cha (“white green tea”): a misty spring morning in Anji County, Zhejiang, with dense bamboo forests framing a small tea garden; close foreground detail of extremely pale, almost white, yellow‑green tea buds shaped like slender jade needles (one bud with a tiny leaf), shimmering with dew; a clear glass cup nearby showing a luminous, crystal-clear green‑gold liquor and a few “dancing” pale leaves; subtle emphasis on the cultivar’s cool-spring chlorophyll mutation through delicate near-white washes transitioning into fresh greens; minimal human presence (a distant tea picker silhouette), serene premium atmosphere, wet-on-wet ink wash textures with restrained color accents, high quality digital art.
