## The Culture: The "King" of Northern Green Teas

Xinyang Maojian is the most famous green tea from Henan Province and is consistently ranked among China's Top Ten Teas. Its history dates back over 2,300 years, with tea production in the region mentioned in Lu Yu's *The Classic of Tea* during the Tang Dynasty.

The name **"Maojian"** describes its appearance: "Mao" refers to the tiny, silvery white downy hairs (trichomes) that cover the tender buds, and "Jian" refers to the sharp, needle-like tips of the processed leaves. In Northern China, it is often called the "King of Green Teas" for its exceptionally brisk and refreshing character.

## Geography: The High Peaks of Xinyang

Xinyang is located at the northern edge of China's tea-growing regions. The colder climate and mountainous terrain of the **Dabie Mountains** play a crucial role in the tea's flavor.

*   **Terroir:** The tea is grown on high-altitude peaks (300-800m) often shrouded in mist. The cooler northern temperatures slow down the growth of the tea bushes, which allows the leaves to accumulate more amino acids and flavor compounds.
*   **The Soil:** The region has nutrient-rich, slightly acidic soil that is ideal for tea. The combination of cold winters and humid springs gives the tea its signature "sharp" and "fresh" quality.

## Decoding the Grades

Xinyang Maojian is prized for its tiny, uniform buds. One kilogram of top-grade tea can require over **100,000 hand-picked buds**.

### 1. Harvest Timing
*   **Pre-Qingming (Ming Qian):** Harvested before April 5th. These are the "caviar" of Maojian—extremely tender, high in sweetness, and very low in bitterness.
*   **Pre-Rain (Yu Qian):** Harvested in mid-April. These are more robust, with a stronger aroma and a bolder "savory" taste.

### 2. Picking Standards
*   **Special Grade:** Pure buds or one bud with one tiny, unfolding leaf. The leaves should be perfectly straight, fine, and covered in white hair.
*   **Grade 1-3:** As the grade increases, the leaves get larger, the color gets darker, and the flavor becomes more "grassy" rather than "buttery."
