An artistic illustration for the tea page “Dongting Biluochun (Green Snail Spring - 洞庭碧螺春)”: layered mountain terraces in morning mist, minimal serene composition; a clear glass cup nearby with luminous, crystal-clear liquor; subtle calligraphy-style label with the tea name (English only, no logos); wet-on-wet ink wash textures with restrained color accents and soft paper grain; show tiny snail-rolled spirals with fuzzy buds in a glass cup; premium, calm, museum-poster feel, high quality digital art.
