## The History: The "Scary" Fragrance

Biluochun is one of China’s most famous green teas, with a history dating back to the Tang Dynasty. However, its modern name was given by the **Emperor Kangxi** of the Qing Dynasty.

Before the Emperor's visit, the tea was known by the locals as **"Aroma that Scares People"** (Xia Sha Ren Xiang) because of its incredibly intense floral scent. The Emperor, finding the name too uncouth for such a delicate tea, renamed it **"Biluochun"**—"Bi" for its green color, "Luo" for its snail-like curled shape, and "Chun" for the spring season.

## Geography: The Inter-cropping of Dongting

The best Biluochun comes from **Dongting Mountain** (divided into East and West hills) on the shores of Lake Tai in Jiangsu Province.

What makes this terroir unique is the **inter-cropping system**. Tea bushes are planted alongside fruit trees like peach, apricot, plum, and pomegranate. During the spring, the tea buds absorb the fragrance of the falling fruit blossoms, giving the tea its natural, unmistakable floral and fruity aroma.

## Decoding the Grades

Biluochun is famous for being incredibly labor-intensive. One kilogram of high-quality tea can require over **60,000 to 80,000 tiny buds**.

### 1. Harvest Timing
*   **Ming Qian (Pre-Qingming):** Picked before April 5th. These are the smallest, hairiest, and most fragrant buds. They are the most expensive.
*   **Yu Qian (Before the Rains):** Picked after April 5th. The leaves are slightly larger, and the flavor is bolder and more vegetal.

### 2. Physical Grades
*   **Special Grade (Te Ji):** Covered in white downy hairs, uniform snail-shape, and tiny size.
*   **Grades 1-3:** As the grade increases, the leaves become less hairy and larger, with a more pronounced "grassy" flavor.

## How to Identify Quality

Biluochun is unique because the leaves are so dense and hairy that they sink immediately when dropped into water.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Imitation) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly curled (snail-like), covered in fine white downy hairs. | Loose, straight, or "bald" leaves (no hair). |
| **Aroma** | Intense floral and fruity (peach/plum) scent. | Grassy, fishy, or very faint. |
| **Liquor** | Pale green-yellow with many tiny hairs floating (a sign of freshness). | Clear but dull yellow or brownish. |
| **Taste** | Refreshing, sweet, and velvety; no bitterness. | Harsh, astringent, or thin. |

## Reputable Brands & Where to Buy

Biluochun is widely produced outside of Dongting (often called "Sichuan Biluochun"). While these can be good daily teas, they lack the fruit-tree aroma of the original.

### Reputable Specialized Brands:
*   **Suzhou Local Brands:** Look for *Sanwan* or *Dongting* (the official regional brand).
*   **International-Friendly Online Shops:**
    *   **Teavivre:** Offers several grades of authentic Dongting Biluochun.
    *   **Seven Cups:** Excellent for sourcing high-end, award-winning Jiangsu greens.
    *   **Meimei Fine Teas:** Focuses on the "Pre-Qingming" ultra-premium harvests.
    *   **Verdant Tea:** Great for small-batch versions with detailed farmer stories.

Biluochun is a tea of pure elegance. To appreciate it best, use the **"Top-Drop" brewing method**: Fill your glass with hot water first, then drop the leaves in and watch them sink like "green snow" to the bottom.
