## The History: The Tea of the Yellow Mountain

Huangshan Maofeng is one of China's "Top Ten" teas, originating in the late 19th century during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. It was created by a merchant named Xie Zhengan, who founded the famous "Xie Yuda" tea company.

The name "Maofeng" refers to the appearance of the tea: "Mao" means the white downy hairs that cover the tender buds, and "Feng" means "peak," referring to the sharp, pointed shape of the processed leaves and the mountain peaks where they grow. It has been a mainstay of Chinese diplomatic gifts for decades.

## Geography: The "Sea of Clouds"

The tea is grown in the **Huangshan (Yellow Mountain)** range in Anhui Province, a UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its jagged granite peaks, ancient pine trees, and "sea of clouds."

*   **Terroir:** The tea gardens are situated between 700 and 800 meters. The high altitude and frequent fog protect the tea leaves from excessive sunlight, allowing them to retain more chlorophyll and amino acids.
*   **The Soil:** The soil is derived from weathered granite and is rich in organic matter, which contributes to the tea's clean, "mountain" flavor.

## Decoding the Grades

Huangshan Maofeng is known for its "bird's tongue" shape—a single bud with one or two tender leaves.

### 1. Harvest Timing
*   **Pre-Qingming (Ming Qian):** The first and most valuable harvest. The leaves are tiny, extremely tender, and have the most delicate floral aroma.
*   **Pre-Rain (Yu Qian):** Harvested in mid-April. The leaves are larger, and the flavor is more robust and "savory."

### 2. Picking Standards
*   **Special Grade (Te Ji):** Pure buds or one bud with one tiny leaf. The leaves should be uniform and a vibrant "ivory" green.
*   **Grades 1-3:** Larger leaves, less downy hair, and a more pronounced vegetal/grassy profile.

## How to Identify Quality

A good Maofeng should be fresh, sweet, and leave a "cool" feeling in the throat.
