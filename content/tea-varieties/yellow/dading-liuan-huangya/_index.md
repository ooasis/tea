## The Culture: The Imperial Sprout of Anhui

Dading Liuan Huangya is a rare and prestigious **Yellow Tea** from the Lu'an (Liu An) region of Anhui Province. Its history is deeply tied to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, where it was served as a "Tribute Tea" to the Imperial Court.

The name "Dading" refers to **Dading Peak**, one of the core production zones. While the region is more famous for its "Melon Seed" green tea (Lu'an Gua Pian), the Huangya (Yellow Sprout) is a more refined, bud-heavy style that undergoes the traditional "Yellowing" process. It is a tea that represents the pinnacle of Anhui's yellow tea craftsmanship—elegant, mellow, and exceptionally smooth.

## The "Yellowing" Process: Men Huang

What separates Dading Huangya from a standard green tea is the **Men Huang** (Sealing Yellow) step.

After the tender buds are pan-fired, they are wrapped in paper or cloth while still warm and humid. This process triggers a very light, non-enzymatic oxidation that transforms the tea. For Dading Huangya, this is a delicate balance: the tea must lose its "grassy" bite but retain its vibrant "sweet corn" and "floral" soul. The result is a liquor that is much softer and more "rounded" than a typical green tea.

## Geography: The Granite Peaks of Lu'an

The tea is grown in the **Dabie Mountains** of Lu'an, Anhui.

*   **Terroir:** The best tea comes from **Dading Peak** and the surrounding high-altitude areas (over 800m). The region is characterized by weathered granite soil, which is exceptionally rich in minerals.
*   **The Micro-climate:** High humidity, frequent fog, and a significant temperature difference between day and night allow the tea buds to develop slowly, accumulating a high concentration of amino acids (the "sweetness" molecule).

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Dading Huangya should be "Bright, Sweet, and Velvety."

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Plump, uniform buds with a yellowish-green (ivory) color and a subtle golden sheen. | Dark green, broken, or thin buds; looking like green tea. |
| **Aroma** | Sweet corn, toasted beans, and a delicate "orchid" fragrance. | Grassy, flat, or excessively vegetal. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright yellowish-green or light gold. | Dull yellow or cloudy. |
| **Taste** | Exceptionally smooth, sweet, with a "mellow" and thick mouthfeel. | Thin, watery, or harshly bitter/astringent. |
