## The Culture: The "Tribute" of the Mountains

Gong Mei (literally "Tribute Eyebrow") is a traditional variety of white tea that occupies a unique space between the delicate **White Peony** and the robust **Shou Mei**. Historically, it was the highest-quality "leaf-style" white tea presented to the imperial court, hence the name "Tribute."

What sets Gong Mei apart is the specific cultivar used. While most modern white teas (like Silver Needle) use the *Fuding Dahao* (Large Bud) cultivar, authentic Gong Mei is traditionally made from **"Xiao Bai"** (Small White), a wild or semi-wild tea bush variety. This gives it a more "primitive," earthy, and complex flavor profile compared to its cultivated cousins.

## Geography: The Wild Slopes of Northern Fujian

Gong Mei is primarily produced in **Fuding, Zhenghe, Jianyang, and Songxi** counties in Fujian Province.

*   **Terroir:** The tea is grown in mountainous areas with red and yellow soil. The "Xiao Bai" bushes are often scattered among other plants, absorbing the minerals and scents of the surrounding forest.
*   **The Traditional Process:** Like all white teas, Gong Mei is simply withered and dried. However, because it uses smaller leaves and more stems than White Peony, the withering process is often slightly longer, allowing for a deeper, more honey-like oxidation.

## Decoding the Grades

Gong Mei is often confused with Shou Mei, but it is technically a higher grade due to its picking standard and cultivar.

### 1. The Picking Standard
*   **One Bud, Two or Three Leaves:** Gong Mei features a higher percentage of buds than Shou Mei. The leaves are also smaller and more tender.
*   **The "Xiao Bai" Factor:** Authentic Gong Mei made from wild *Xiao Bai* bushes is the highest grade, prized for its intense sweetness and "mountain charm."

### 2. Aging Potential
Gong Mei is a superstar for **aging**. Over 5–10 years, it loses its "green" edge and develops a thick, medicinal, and honey-sweet profile that is highly sought after by collectors.

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Gong Mei should be "Colorful and Sweet," with a distinct forest-like aroma.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly twisted leaves with many small silvery buds; a mix of green, brown, and silver colors. | Mostly broken, grayish-black leaves with no visible buds or silver down. |
| **Aroma** | Wild flowers, fresh hay, honey, and a hint of woodiness. | Musty, stale, or "sour" smelling. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright orange or deep golden-yellow. | Dull yellow or murky brown. |
| **Taste** | Refreshingly sweet, thick mouthfeel, and a lingering floral finish. | Thin, watery, or harshly astringent. |

Gong Mei is the "wild child" of white tea. It is more complex and earthy than White Peony but more refined than Shou Mei. If you love **honey and forest** notes, a 3–5 year aged Gong Mei will be a revelation.
