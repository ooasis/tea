## The Culture: The "Humility" of White Tea

Shou Mei (literally "Longevity Eyebrow") is the most affordable and widely consumed variety of white tea. While **Silver Needle** is the "Emperor" and **White Peony** is the "Beauty," Shou Mei is often called the "Commoner" of white tea.

The name "Longevity Eyebrow" refers to the appearance of the dried tea: the thin, wiry leaves and silvery-white hairs resemble the long, wispy eyebrows of an old man (a symbol of wisdom and long life in Chinese culture). While it was traditionally seen as a "lower" grade, Shou Mei has gained immense respect in recent years because of its incredible potential for **aging**.

## Geography: The Sunshine of Fuding

Like its more famous siblings, Shou Mei is primarily grown in **Fuding and Zhenghe** in Fujian Province.

*   **Terroir:** The tea is harvested later in the spring and into the autumn. Because the leaves are more mature, they are thicker and contain more natural sugars and minerals.
*   **The Sunshine Drying:** Traditionally, Shou Mei is simply withered in the sun and dried. This minimal processing allows the tea's natural enzymes to remain active, which is the secret to its transformation over time.

## Decoding the Grades & Aging

Shou Mei is primarily categorized by its **harvest season** and its **age**.

### 1. Spring vs. Autumn
*   **Spring Shou Mei:** Harvested in late April/May. More floral, lighter, and closer to a "big leaf" White Peony.
*   **Autumn Shou Mei (Gong Mei):** Harvested in September/October. Known for a thicker body, notes of "Chinese dates," and a richer, darker liquor.

### 2. The Rule of Seven Years
In China, there is a famous saying about white tea: *"One-year tea, three-year medicine, seven-year treasure."*
*   **New Shou Mei:** Fresh, floral, and slightly "green."
*   **Aged Shou Mei (3+ years):** The flavor transforms into honey, dried jujube (red dates), and medicinal herbs. The color of the liquor turns from gold to deep amber.

## How to Identify Quality

A good Shou Mei should be "Sturdy and Sweet," never musty or brittle.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Whole leaves with visible stems and some silvery buds; vibrant colors (green/brown/silver). | Mostly dust and broken leaves; uniformly black or dull gray. |
| **Aroma** | Fresh hay, wild flowers, honey, and red dates (if aged). | Musty, "pond-y," or no aroma at all. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright orange or golden-yellow; oily texture. | Dull, murky, or muddy brown. |
| **Taste** | Sweet, thick mouthfeel, exceptionally smooth, and "refreshing." | Thin, watery, or harshly astringent/acidic. |

Shou Mei is the "Introvert's" white tea—it takes time to reveal its true depth. If you find other white teas too "light," try an **aged Shou Mei (3-5 years)**. It is incredibly easy to brew (use boiling water and steep as long as you like) and provides a deep, honey-sweet comfort that few other teas can match.
