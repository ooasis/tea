## The Culture: The "Middle Path" of White Tea

Bai Mudan, or "White Peony," is the most popular style of white tea for daily drinking. Its name is inspired by the way the green leaves and silvery buds unfurl in the cup, resembling the blooming of a white peony flower.

While **Silver Needle** (Baihao Yinzhen) is made entirely of buds and is very delicate, and **Shou Mei** is made of mature leaves and is quite bold, Bai Mudan sits perfectly in the middle. It consists of **one bud and two leaves**, offering a balance of the bud's sweetness and the leaves' body and complexity. It is the "everyman's" white tea—sophisticated yet approachable.

## Geography: The Heart of Fujian

Authentic White Peony comes from the same regions as Silver Needle: **Fuding** and **Zhenghe** in Fujian Province.

*   **Fuding Style:** Usually dried in the sun or under mild heat. These teas are brighter, greener, and have a more floral, "fresh hay" profile.
*   **Zhenghe Style:** Often involves a longer, slightly more fermented drying process. These teas are darker, richer, and have more "honey" and "baked bread" notes.

The climate in these coastal mountain regions—misty, humid, and moderately warm—is essential for the slow drying process that allows the tea to oxidize naturally and gently.

## Decoding the Grades

In White Peony, the grade is determined by the "freshness" of the leaves and the ratio of buds to leaves.

### 1. Mudan Wang (King Peony)
The highest grade of Bai Mudan. It has a very high ratio of silvery buds and tiny, tender leaves. It is very close to Silver Needle in flavor but with more "green" complexity.

### 2. Traditional Bai Mudan
The standard "one bud, two leaves" picking. It has a thicker body and more "fruitiness" than the King Peony.

### 3. Aging Potential
Bai Mudan is perhaps the best white tea for **aging**. Over 3-10 years, it transforms from a floral green tea into a deep, medicinal, honey-sweet brew that is highly prized in China for its health benefits.

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Bai Mudan should feature the **"Three White"** characteristic: the bud and the undersides of the two leaves should all be covered in silvery white down.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Visible silvery buds; whole, unbroken leaves; "Three White" downy hairs. | Broken leaves, mostly brown/black; no visible buds or down. |
| **Aroma** | Fresh hay, honeysuckle, soy milk, and stone fruit (apricot). | Musty, stale, or "sour" smelling. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright apricot or golden-yellow. | Dull yellow or murky brown. |
| **Taste** | Sweet, "sparkling" texture, silky mouthfeel, with a fruity finish. | Thin, watery, or metallic. |

Bai Mudan is the most versatile white tea. You can brew it delicately at 85°C to bring out the florals, or "grandpa style" (leaving the leaves in the cup) with boiling water to reveal its sweet, honey-thick body.
