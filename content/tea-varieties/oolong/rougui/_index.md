## The Culture: The "Aggressive" Fragrance

Rougui (literally "Cinnamon") is the "powerhouse" of the Wuyi Rock Tea (Yancha) family. While Da Hong Pao is the "King," Rougui is often called the **"General"** or the "Aromatic King" because of its bold, spicy, and long-lasting fragrance.

Originally discovered in the Majia Canyon of the Wuyi Mountains, Rougui has exploded in popularity over the last few decades. It is a tea for those who love intensity—it doesn't hide its character. In the world of tea connoisseurs, there is a saying: *"Fragrance doesn't surpass Rougui, and water doesn't surpass Shuixian."* This highlights Rougui's undisputed dominance in aroma.

## Geography: The "Baxian" and the Rock Rhyme

Rougui is grown in the UNESCO-listed **Wuyi Mountains** in Northern Fujian. The terroir is everything here.

*   **Zheng Yan (Authentic Rock):** The core area. Rougui grown in places like **Ma Tou Yan** (Horse Head Rock) or **Niu Lan Keng** (Cow Pen Pit) is legendary. "Niu Rou" (Rougui from Niu Lan Keng) is one of the most expensive and sought-after teas in China.
*   **The Rock Rhyme (Yan Yun):** The tea absorbs minerals from the sandstone cliffs. This gives it a "heavy" feeling in the throat and a lingering, savory, mineral finish that persists through many steepings.

## Decoding the Grades

Rougui is primarily defined by its **aroma type** and its **source rock**.

### 1. Aroma Profiles
*   **Cinnamon (Rougui):** The signature spicy, woody, and warm aroma.
*   **Floral/Fruit:** High-quality Rougui often features notes of orchid, peach, or dried longan underneath the spice.

### 2. Roast Levels
*   **Medium Roast (Zhong Huo):** The standard. Balanced spice and floral notes with a nutty depth.
*   **Heavy Roast (Zu Huo):** Deeply chocolatey, smoky, and intense. This style is designed for aging and for those who enjoy the "fire" of the roast.

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Rougui should be "Domineering" (Ba Qi) but balanced.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly twisted, dark, sturdy leaves; uniform color. | Broken, loose, or grayish leaves with many stems. |
| **Aroma** | Sharp, warm cinnamon spice; "penetrating" fragrance that stays in the cup. | Faint, flat, or excessively smoky/burnt smelling. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, amber-orange; bright oily sheen (sign of high minerals). | Dull yellow or cloudy. |
| **Taste** | Bold spice, "Yan Yun" mineral depth, sweet aftertaste (Huigan). | Thin, watery, or harshly bitter/astringent. |
