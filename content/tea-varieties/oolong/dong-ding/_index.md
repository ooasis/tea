## The History: The Frozen Summit

Dong Ding (literally "Frozen Summit") is perhaps the most famous of all Taiwanese oolongs. Its origins date back to the mid-19th century when a scholar brought 12 tea seedlings from the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian to the Lugu area of Taiwan.

The name "Frozen Summit" refers to the steep, slippery slopes of the mountain where the tea was grown—local farmers had to "freeze" their toes to grip the muddy path as they climbed. This tea pioneered the traditional **medium-roast, medium-oxidation** style that defined Taiwanese tea for generations before the modern trend toward "high mountain" light oolongs.

## Geography: The Mist of Lugu

The heart of Dong Ding production is **Lugu Township** in Nantou County, Central Taiwan.

*   **Elevation:** Typically 600–1,000 meters. While not as high as "High Mountain" (Gao Shan) teas, the unique soil and constant afternoon mist of Lugu create a concentrated, robust flavor.
*   **The Soil:** Red clay soil that is rich in iron, which contributes to the tea's deep mineral backbone.
*   **Heritage:** The tea is still produced using traditional rolling and roasting techniques that have been passed down for over 150 years.

## Decoding the Styles: Traditional vs. Competition

In Taiwan, Dong Ding is the star of the world's largest tea competition.

### 1. Traditional Dong Ding
Slow-roasted over charcoal for several days. 
*   **Profile:** Amber liquor, nutty, honeyed, with a distinct "charred" but sweet finish.
*   **Vibe:** Heavy, comforting, and great for multiple steepings.

### 2. Modern/Competition Style
Often lighter in roast to highlight the floral notes of the leaf.
*   **Profile:** Golden-yellow liquor, more orchid-like, but with a lingering toasted aftertaste.
*   **Vibe:** Elegant and complex.

## How to Identify Quality

A true Dong Ding should have a "honey-sweet" roasted character, never an ashy or burnt taste.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly rolled "hemispherical" beads; dark green-brown. | Loose, uneven rolls or many stems; grayish-black. |
| **Aroma** | Toasted nuts, honey, dried fruit, and a hint of orchid. | Burnt charcoal, stale hay, or no aroma. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright amber or golden-orange; viscous. | Dull yellow or murky brown. |
| **Taste** | "Hou Yun" (throat rhyme)—a sweet, lingering finish; thick body. | Thin, watery, or harshly bitter. |
