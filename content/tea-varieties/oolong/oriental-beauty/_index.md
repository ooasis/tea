## The History: The Tea Bitten by Insects

Oriental Beauty (Dongfang Meiren) is perhaps the most unique oolong in the world. Its story begins with a "mistake" in the late 19th century.

A farmer in Hsinchu, Taiwan, noticed that his tea crop had been heavily infested by tiny insects called **Green Leafhoppers**. Rather than throwing the crop away, he processed the bitten leaves. The result was a tea with a startlingly sweet, honey-like aroma. When he took it to a merchant, it sold for a record price. His neighbors didn't believe him, calling it "Bragger's Tea" (*Peng Feng Cha*). 

The name "Oriental Beauty" was allegedly given by **Queen Elizabeth II** (some say Queen Victoria), who was so captivated by the tea's colorful leaves "dancing" in her glass that she gave it this royal title.

## Geography: The Summer Heat of Hsinchu

Unlike most premium teas that are harvested in the spring, Oriental Beauty is a **summer tea**, harvested in June and July when the Green Leafhopper population is at its peak.

*   **Terroir:** The main production areas are **Hsinchu and Miaoli** in Taiwan. The environment must be strictly **organic**—if pesticides are used, the leafhoppers won't bite the leaves, and the tea won't develop its signature flavor.
*   **The Bite:** When the insect bites the tea leaf, the plant releases a defense chemical that reacts with the air, starting a "pre-oxidation" process while the leaf is still on the bush. This is what creates the natural honey and ripe fruit flavors.

## Decoding the Grades

Oriental Beauty is highly oxidized (60-80%), making it closer to a red tea than a green oolong.

### 1. The Color Palette
High-quality Oriental Beauty is also called **"Five-Color Oolong"** because the dried leaves should feature five distinct colors: white, green, yellow, red, and brown. The more white buds (Bai Hao) present, the higher the grade.

### 2. The Fragrance
*   **Special Grade:** Intense honey, musk, and ripe peach.
*   **Standard Grade:** Sweet, floral, and slightly woody.

## How to Identify Quality

A true Oriental Beauty is defined by its natural, unforced sweetness.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Distinct "five colors" with many white downy buds. | Uniformly dark or brown; few or no white buds. |
| **Aroma** | Explosive natural honey, lychee, and rose. | Faintly sweet, woody, or stale. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright amber-orange; oily sheen. | Dull yellow or murky brown. |
| **Taste** | Sparkling sweetness (like honey water), smooth, and fruity. | Thin, astringent, or metallic. |

Oriental Beauty is the "perfume" of the tea world. It is one of the few teas that should be brewed with **slightly cooler water** (80-85°C) to protect its delicate honeyed notes. It is a masterpiece of collaboration between nature, insects, and human skill.
