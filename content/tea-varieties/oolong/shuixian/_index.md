## The Culture: The "Gentle Giant" of Wuyi

Shuixian (literally "Narcissus" or "Water Sprite") is one of the oldest and most widely planted varieties of Wuyi Rock Tea. While Rougui is known for its aggressive aroma, Shuixian is loved for its **smooth, thick, and velvety "water" (liquor)**.

In the world of Yancha, there is a saying: *"Fragrance doesn't surpass Rougui, and water doesn't surpass Shuixian."* This means that Shuixian is the undisputed champion of texture and body. It is a "heavy" tea that feels substantial in the mouth, often revealing a sophisticated floral elegance that grows deeper with every steep.

## Geography: The Ancient Trees of the Rock

Shuixian is grown throughout the **Wuyi Mountains** in Northern Fujian, but it is particularly famous for its longevity.

*   **Lao Cong (Old Tree):** Shuixian is one of the few oolong varieties that is regularly harvested from trees over 50–100 years old. These "Old Tree" Shuixians have a unique **"Cong Wei"** (Old Tree Taste)—a woody, mossy, and mineral-rich flavor that is impossible to replicate with younger bushes.
*   **The Soil:** Like all Wuyi Yancha, it grows in the sandstone and weathered rock of the UNESCO-listed park. The minerals in the soil are what give the tea its "Rock Rhyme" (Yan Yun).

## Decoding the Grades

Shuixian is primarily graded by the **age of the tree** and the **roast level**.

### 1. Tree Age (The Most Important Factor)
*   **Lao Cong Shuixian:** From trees over 50 years old. Deep, woody, and complex.
*   **Gao Cong Shuixian:** From trees over 30 years old. Balanced and smooth.
*   **Standard Shuixian:** From younger bushes. More floral and bright.

### 2. Roast Levels
*   **Medium Roast:** Highlights the natural floral (lily/orchid) and honeyed notes.
*   **Heavy Roast:** Deeply toasted, chocolatey, and smoky. This style is excellent for long-term aging, as the tea becomes smoother and more "medicinal" over time.

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Shuixian should be "Thick and Smooth" (Chou Hua).

| **Liquor** | Clear, deep amber-orange; viscous and oily. | Dull yellow or cloudy. |
| **Taste** | Thick mouthfeel, silky texture, "Yan Yun" mineral finish, very sweet. | Thin, watery, or harshly bitter/astringent. |

Shuixian is the "comfort food" of the Yancha world. It is smooth, sweet, and incredibly satisfying. If you find other oolongs too "perfumey," a **medium-roasted Shuixian** with its thick body and honeyed finish will be your new favorite.
