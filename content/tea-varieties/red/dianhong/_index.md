## The History: The Golden Red of the West

Dianhong (literally "Yunnan Red") is a relatively young category of tea, first created in **1939** in Fengqing County. It was developed during the Second Sino-Japanese War as a high-quality export tea to earn foreign currency for the war effort.

Despite its young age, it quickly gained international fame. In 1986, it was presented as a state gift to **Queen Elizabeth II** during her visit to China. The Queen was so impressed by the tea's golden color and sweet aroma that it remains a favorite among many Western tea lovers today.

## Geography: The High Altitude of Lincang

Dianhong is grown in the high-altitude mountains of southwestern Yunnan, primarily in **Lincang** and **Fengqing**.

The terroir here is dominated by:
*   **Large-Leaf Cultivars (Da Ye):** Unlike the small-leaf bushes of Fujian, Yunnan uses the same *Assamica* variety used for Pu-erh. This gives the tea a bolder body and higher concentration of polyphenols.
*   **Red Soil:** The iron-rich soil of Yunnan contributes to the tea's natural sweetness and "malty" character.

## Decoding the Grades

Dianhong is easily identified by its **golden buds**. The more gold you see, the higher the grade.

### 1. Common Grades
*   **Dianhong Golden Buds (Jin Ya):** 100% pure buds. This is the highest grade—extremely sweet and smooth.
*   **Golden Needle (Jin Zhen):** Similar to Golden Buds but processed into a needle-like shape.
*   **Pine Needle (Song Zhen):** Long, straight leaves with a mix of buds and leaves.
*   **Broken/Standard Dianhong:** Often used for blending or daily drinking.

### 2. Sourcing
*   **Old Tree Dianhong (Gushu):** Made from ancient tea trees. These are the "prestige" versions with a much deeper, more complex aftertaste.

## How to Identify Quality

A good Dianhong should smell like a bakery in autumn—warm, sweet, and inviting.

Dianhong is the perfect tea for those who enjoy **English Breakfast** or **Assam** but want something smoother and more naturally sweet. It is one of the few Chinese teas that can handle a splash of milk, though it is best enjoyed plain to appreciate its honeyed soul.
