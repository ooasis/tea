## The History: The World's First Black Tea

Lapsang Souchong holds the title of the **world's first black (red) tea**, originating in the late Ming Dynasty. 

Legend has it that an army passing through the Wuyi Mountains camped at a tea factory. Their presence delayed the drying of the fresh leaves. To save the crop, the farmers sped up the drying process by burning local pine wood. The leaves absorbed the resinous smoke, creating a unique, bold flavor. To their surprise, Dutch traders loved the smoky tea, and it became an international sensation, eventually becoming the favorite tea of Winston Churchill and Sherlock Holmes.

## Geography: The Mist of Tongmu Village

The only place that can produce authentic Lapsang Souchong is **Tongmu Village** within the Wuyi Nature Reserve. 

*   **Zheng Shan (Original Mountain):** Refers to tea grown within the strict boundaries of Tongmu.
*   **Souchong (Xiao Zhong):** Refers to the "small leaf" variety of tea bush native to the area.

The village is high-altitude, secluded, and pristine. The ecosystem is so protected that non-residents often need special permits to enter. This terroir produces a tea with a natural "longan" fruit sweetness that imitation teas lack.

## Decoding the Styles: Smoked vs. Unsmoked

Many Westerners think all Lapsang is smoky, but the "Traditional" Chinese style has shifted.

### 1. Traditional Smoked (Yanyuan)
The classic "campfire" tea. It is dried in a multi-story wooden building called a *Qinglou*, where pine smoke rises through the floors.
*   **Profile:** Intense pine smoke, campfire, dried longan fruit.

### 2. Unsmoked (Feiyan)
Highly popular in China today. It uses the same high-quality Tongmu leaves but omits the smoking step.
*   **Profile:** Honey, chocolate, rose, and stone fruit. Much more delicate.

### 3. Jin Jun Mei (Golden Steeds)
A modern, ultra-premium spinoff made only from tiny buds. It is essentially the "prestige" version of Lapsang.

## How to Identify Quality

A good Lapsang should never taste like a "liquid ashtray."

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Imitation) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly twisted, dark black-brown leaves; no dust. | Broken, grayish, or thick stems. |
| **Aroma** | Sweet pine smoke, dried fruit (longan), honey. | Acrid, chemical, or "burnt rubber" smell. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright orange or deep amber. | Dull, cloudy, or murky brown. |
| **Taste** | Sweet, cooling, smooth; smoke is a background note. | Harshly bitter, drying (astringent), or overly acidic. |

True Tongmu Lapsang is expensive and rare. Be wary of very cheap versions labeled "Lapsang Souchong"—they are often low-grade tea from other regions sprayed with liquid smoke.

### Reputable Specialized Brands:
*   **Zheng Shan Tang:** The most prestigious brand, credited with inventing Jin Jun Mei.
*   **International-Friendly Online Shops:**
    *   **Wuyi Origin:** Direct from the source in Tongmu village.
    *   **Old Ways Tea:** Excellent traditionally smoked and unsmoked versions.
