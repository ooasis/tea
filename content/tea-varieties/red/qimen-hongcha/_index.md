## The History: The "Burgundy" of Teas

Qimen Hongcha, better known in the West as **Keemun**, is widely considered the most prestigious red tea in China. It was first created in 1875 by a failed civil servant named Yu Ganchen, who traveled to Fujian to learn the secrets of red tea and brought them back to his home in Qimen, Anhui.

Within a few years, Keemun became a favorite of the British aristocracy and remains the primary component of many premium **English Breakfast** blends. In the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, it won a gold medal, cementing its status as one of the world's three most fragrant teas (alongside Darjeeling and Ceylon). It is often called the "Burgundy of teas" for its complex, wine-like depth.

## Geography: The Yellow Mountains of Anhui

Qimen County is located in the southern part of Anhui Province, surrounded by the foothills of the famous **Huangshan (Yellow Mountain)**.

*   **Terroir:** The region is heavily forested with a cool, misty climate and high rainfall. The soil is slightly acidic and rich in organic matter.
*   **Biodiversity:** The lush environment and high altitude contribute to the tea's unique chemical profile, particularly its high levels of **geraniol**, which gives Keemun its signature "rose" and "orchid" fragrance.

## Decoding the Grades

Keemun grading can be complex, involving both traditional Chinese and Western export standards.

### 1. Traditional Grades
*   **Keemun Hao Ya (A/B):** The highest grade, made primarily from tiny, tender buds and leaves. "Hao Ya A" is the absolute peak of Keemun.
*   **Keemun Mao Feng:** A whole-leaf variety that is less processed (not cut), offering a more floral and delicate profile.
*   **Keemun Gongfu:** The traditional "workmanlike" tea, finely cut and highly oxidized for a bold, classic flavor.

### 2. The "Keemun Fragrance"
Regardless of grade, all authentic Keemun should possess the **"Qimen Xiang"**—a unique combination of rose, dried plum, and a hint of smoky pine.

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Keemun is refined and elegant, never harsh or overly smoky.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly twisted, fine, black-blue leaves; uniform in size. | Broken, grayish-brown leaves with dust and stems. |
| **Aroma** | "Keemun Fragrance"—rose, orchid, honey, and a hint of unsweetened cocoa. | Sour, flat, or like wet cardboard. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, brilliant ruby red; bright orange "ring" at the rim. | Dull, murky, or muddy brown. |
| **Taste** | Smooth, velvety, with notes of stone fruit (plum/peach) and a clean finish. | Harshly astringent, bitter, or acidic. |

## Reputable Brands & Where to Buy

Because it is so popular, much of what is labeled "Keemun" in supermarkets is actually low-grade red tea from other provinces.

### Reputable Specialized Brands:
*   **Keemun Tea Group:** The descendant of the original state-run factories in Qimen.
*   **International-Friendly Online Shops:**

Keemun is a "gentleman's tea"—sophisticated, balanced, and timeless. It is best enjoyed plain to appreciate its floral complexity, though it is the only Chinese red tea that can truly stand up to a dash of milk if you prefer a traditional Western style.
