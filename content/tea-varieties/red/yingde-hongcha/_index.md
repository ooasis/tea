## The History: The Royal Favorite of Guangdong

Yingde Hongcha is the most famous red tea from Guangdong Province. While tea has been grown in Yingde for centuries, the modern "Hongcha" industry was established in the **1950s** as part of a national effort to create high-quality export teas.

In 1963, Yingde Hongcha was presented to the **British Royal Family**. It was so well-received that it became a staple in the Royal household's afternoon tea ceremonies. It is often compared to high-end Ceylon or Assam teas but with a distinct "Chinese" sweetness and floral complexity that makes it a favorite for those who enjoy a bold yet refined cup.

## Geography: The Limestone Peaks of Yingde

Yingde is located in the northern part of Guangdong Province, a region characterized by spectacular karst (limestone) mountains and a subtropical climate.

*   **Terroir:** The red soil in Yingde is rich in organic matter and minerals. The humid, rainy climate and the mist from the surrounding mountains provide the perfect environment for "Large Leaf" tea cultivars.
*   **The Yinghong No. 9 Cultivar:** This is the "Superstar" of Yingde. Developed in the 1960s, this cultivar is famous for producing tea that is exceptionally sweet, thick, and aromatic, with a distinct note of **honey and cocoa**.

## Decoding the Grades

Yingde Hongcha is primarily graded by the picking standard and the specific cultivar used.

### 1. Yinghong No. 9 (The Top Grade)
This is the most sought-after variety. It is further divided by the picking date:
*   **Special Grade (Jin Hao):** Made entirely of golden buds. It is extremely sweet and smooth.
*   **First Grade:** One bud and one or two leaves. Offers a perfect balance of aroma and body.

### 2. Standard Yingde Red
Often a blend of different cultivars. These are excellent for daily drinking and are more affordable.

## How to Identify Quality

A good Yingde Hongcha should be bold and aromatic, but never "harsh" or bitter.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly twisted, dark leaves with a high percentage of golden buds. | Broken, grayish, or dusty leaves; no golden buds. |
| **Aroma** | Intense honey, sweet potato, and natural cocoa. | Flat, musty, or overly smoky. |
| **Liquor** | Bright, clear, deep orange-red with a golden ring. | Dull, murky, or muddy brown. |
| **Taste** | Thick, malty sweetness with a "floral" lift and a clean finish. | Thin, watery, or harshly astringent/acidic. |
