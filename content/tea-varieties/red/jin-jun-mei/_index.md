## The History: The Modern Legend of Wuyi

Jin Jun Mei is one of the most famous and expensive red teas in the world, yet it was only invented in **2005**. It was developed by a team of tea masters at the **Zheng Shan Tang** company in the Wuyi Mountains, led by Jiang Yuanxun.

The name is highly symbolic:
*   **Jin (Golden):** Refers to the golden-colored buds and the "precious" nature of the tea.
*   **Jun (Steed):** Refers to the "horses" used in the Ancient Tea Horse Road and the wish for the tea to spread quickly like a galloping horse.
*   **Mei (Eyebrow):** Refers to the shape of the tea—tiny, curved buds that resemble the eyebrows of a classic beauty.

It took the tea world by storm, elevating the status of Chinese red tea (Hongcha) to the level of prestige normally reserved for rare oolongs or aged Pu-erh.

## Geography: The Heights of Tongmu

Authentic Jin Jun Mei can only be produced in **Tongmu Village**, a pristine nature reserve in the Wuyi Mountains of Fujian.

*   **Pristine Terroir:** The village is situated at an altitude of 1,200 to 1,500 meters. The air is exceptionally clean, and the ecosystem is strictly protected (non-residents need a permit to enter).
*   **The Bush:** It is made using the "Xiao Zhong" (Small Leaf) wild tea bushes native to Tongmu.
*   **The Labor:** Unlike traditional Lapsang Souchong which uses leaves, Jin Jun Mei is made **entirely of tiny, unopened buds**. It takes approximately **60,000 to 80,000 hand-picked buds** to produce just 500 grams of tea.

## Decoding the Grades

Because of its fame, "Jin Jun Mei" has become a generic term for any bud-heavy red tea. However, true Jin Jun Mei is in a class of its own.

### 1. The Real Deal (Tongmu)
Made from wild-bush buds in Tongmu. It is naturally sweet with notes of honey, flowers, and sweet potato.
### 2. The "Wuyi" Grade
Made from buds grown in the Wuyi area but outside of the Tongmu Reserve. Excellent, but lacks the "mountain charm" and complexity of the original.
### 3. The Imitations
Often made from buds grown in other provinces (like Guangxi or Guizhou). These are often "painted" or processed to look golden but lack the depth and sweetness of true Jin Jun Mei.

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Jin Jun Mei should never be "bright gold." True Jin Jun Mei is actually **mostly black with golden highlights**.

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Imitation) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tiny, slim, curved buds; dark black/brown with a subtle golden shimmer. | Large, thick, or "overly golden/yellow" buds. |
| **Aroma** | Natural honey, rose, dried fruit (longan), and fresh baked bread. | Harshly smoky, artificially sweet, or flat. |
| **Liquor** | Bright, luminous gold or light amber; clear as a diamond. | Dull red or murky brown. |
| **Taste** | Exceptionally smooth, sweet, with "rock rhyme" mineral depth. | Astringent, sour, or metallic. |
