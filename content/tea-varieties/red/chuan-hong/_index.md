## The Culture: The "Red" Soul of Sichuan

Chuan Hong (literally "Sichuan Red") is one of China's most distinctive and high-quality red teas. While Sichuan is world-famous for its green teas (like Zhu Ye Qing), its red tea history is relatively modern, gaining prominence in the **1950s**.

First developed in Yibin, Chuan Hong was created to be a high-end export tea. It quickly earned a reputation for its unique **citrus and orange blossom** aroma, which sets it apart from the malty Dianhong of Yunnan or the floral Keemun of Anhui. In Sichuan, it is celebrated for its elegance and its ability to provide a sweet, warming contrast to the region's famous spicy cuisine.

## Geography: The Golden Triad of Yibin

The heart of Chuan Hong production is **Yibin**, often called the "First City on the Yangtze River."

*   **Terroir:** The region features a subtropical humid climate with plenty of rainfall and mild winters. The soil is red and purple, rich in minerals and slightly acidic—ideal for tea.
*   **Altitude:** The best tea gardens are located at altitudes of 600–1,000 meters. The constant mist from the Yangtze and Min Rivers keeps the tea leaves tender and protects them from harsh sunlight.

## Decoding the Grades

Chuan Hong is primarily identified by its **"Golden Tips"** and its intense aroma.

### 1. The Superstar: Gongfu Red
*   **Special Grade (Jin Ya):** Made entirely of golden buds. It is the most aromatic and sweet, featuring clear notes of orange peel and honey.
*   **First Grade:** One bud and one or two leaves. Offers a perfect balance of citrus aroma and a malty, thick body.

### 2. Harvest Timing
*   **Early Spring:** Like all premium Chinese teas, the earliest spring harvests (starting in late February) are the most prized for their delicate fragrance and high sweetness.

## How to Identify Quality

A high-quality Chuan Hong should be "Aromatic, Sweet, and Bright."

| Feature | High-Quality (Premium) | Lower-Quality (Mass Market) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Tightly twisted leaves with many golden-orange buds; very uniform. | Broken, grayish-black leaves with few or no golden tips. |
| **Aroma** | Distinct orange peel, citrus, honey, and dried fruit. | Sour, flat, or excessively smoky. |
| **Liquor** | Clear, bright orange-red with a brilliant golden "ring" at the rim. | Dull, murky, or muddy brown. |
| **Taste** | Refreshing citrus sweetness, silky mouthfeel, and a clean finish. | Thin, watery, or harshly astringent/acidic. |
