This page is a practical glossary of **tea-making techniques** (kept broad on purpose). Over time, we can expand each item into its own deep dive.

### Core steps you’ll see across categories

- **Plucking**: standard (bud + 1–2 leaves), timing, and leaf tenderness
- **Withering**: reducing moisture to soften leaf and open aroma
- **Fixation / Kill-green (*shāqīng*)**: heat to stop enzymatic oxidation (common in Green/Oolong)
- **Rolling / Shaping**: bruising + forming the leaf (twist, ball, strip, flat-press)
- **Oxidation**: controlled enzymatic browning (critical for Oolong and Red)
- **Drying**: final moisture reduction for stability and shelf-life

### Craft techniques that change character

- **Bruising / shaking (Oolong)**: edge oxidation and aroma development through cycles
- **Roasting**: from light bake to deep charcoal roast; adds depth and reduces sharp edges
- **Microbial fermentation (Dark/Hei Cha)**: post-fermentation that can continue in storage
- **Compression**: cakes/bricks/tongs; affects aging dynamics and storage behavior
