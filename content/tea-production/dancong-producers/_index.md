# Discovering Phoenix Dancong: The Aromatic Oolong

Phoenix Dancong (凤凰单丛, Fènghuáng Dān Cōng) is one of China's most celebrated oolong teas, often hailed as the "perfume of teas" for its astonishing array of natural floral, fruity, and spicy aromas. Originating from the rugged mountains of Guangdong Province, this semi-oxidized tea is crafted from leaves of ancient tea trees, each variety meticulously selected and propagated to preserve its unique scent profile. Unlike many teas that blend leaves from multiple plants, Dancong—meaning "single bush"—emphasizes the individuality of each cultivar, resulting in a sipping experience that's as diverse as it is delightful.

## The Cradle of Phoenix Dancong: Key Producing Areas

The heart of Phoenix Dancong production lies in the **Phoenix Mountains** (凤凰山, Fènghuáng Shān), a misty range in Chao'an District, Chaozhou City, Guangdong Province. This area, with its subtropical climate, rich red soil, and high humidity, provides the ideal terroir for tea cultivation. The mountains span about 50 kilometers, but the prime growing zones are at elevations between 600 and 1,400 meters, where cooler temperatures and abundant fog enhance the tea's complexity.


Among the most renowned spots is **Wudong Peak** (乌岽峰, Wū Dōng Fēng), the highest point in the range at around 1,397 meters. Teas from here, often from trees over 200 years old, are prized for their depth and longevity in flavor. Other notable areas include Daxian Village, Liaotian, and Fenghuang Town, where small family farms hand-pick leaves in spring (typically April-May) for the best harvests.

The production process involves sun-withering, indoor withering, shaking (to bruise the leaves and initiate oxidation), pan-firing, rolling, and baking—steps that lock in those signature aromas while achieving a 30-50% oxidation level.

These high-altitude environments not only protect the tea from pests (reducing the need for chemicals) but also contribute to the tea's "mountain rhyme" (高山韵, Gāo Shān Yùn)—a lingering, mineral-rich aftertaste that's a hallmark of top-grade Dancong.

## Famous Varieties: A Symphony of Scents

Phoenix Dancong varieties aren't defined by leaf shape or processing alone; they're celebrated for their distinct aroma profiles, derived from specific tea tree clones. There are over 80 registered cultivars, but they stem from ancient Shui Xian (水仙, Shuǐ Xiān) stock and are grouped by scent. The most famous are the "Ten Great Aromas" (十大香型, Shí Dà Xiāng Xíng), standardized in the 1990s, each mimicking a natural flower, fruit, or spice.

One standout is **Mi Lan Xiang** (蜜兰香, Mì Lán Xiāng), or Honey Orchid, known for its sweet, honeyed floral notes. Another crowd-pleaser is **Ya Shi Xiang** (鸭屎香, Yā Shǐ Xiāng)—literally "Duck Shit Aroma"—a playful name that belies its elegant silver flower tree scent; legend says farmers coined it to deter thieves. High-end varieties like Jiang Hua Xiang come from old trees at elevations around 900 meters, commanding premium prices for their rarity.

These varieties are propagated via cuttings to maintain genetic purity, ensuring each batch delivers consistent aromas year after year.

For easy comparison, here's a table listing the classic aroma types of Phoenix Dancong. I've included the English translation, Pinyin romanization, and Chinese characters. Many of these aromas evoke specific flowers or fruits, with subtle variations in sweetness, spice, or freshness. Note that Ya Shi Xiang is sometimes categorized under Huang Zhi Xiang but is popular enough to list separately.
