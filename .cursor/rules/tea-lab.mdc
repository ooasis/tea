# Tea & Me — Cursor rules

You are working in a **Hugo static site** repo. Optimize for: correct Hugo behavior, clean Markdown content, and not editing generated artifacts.

> **Note**: For detailed project structure, conventions, and workflows, see `@.cursor/skills/project-overview/SKILL.md`

## Source-of-truth vs generated output

- **Edit these (source of truth)**:
  - `content/**` (Markdown + page bundles)
  - `layouts/**` (templates + shortcodes)
  - `assets/**` (site CSS like `assets/custom.css`)
  - `static/**` (static assets copied as-is)
  - `hugo.toml` (site configuration)
- **Do NOT edit these manually (generated/build artifacts)**:
  - `public/**` (production build output)
  - `resources/_gen/**` (Hugo image pipeline/cache output)

If a user asks for a visual/output change, implement it by changing **source files** above, not `public/`.

## Essential conventions

- **Front matter**: Use YAML front matter with `---` delimiters. Keep `draft: false`, `title`, `tags`, and `date` present for new pages.
- **Content structure**: Start content at `##` (page title comes from front matter).
- **Images**: Use `{{< img src="FILE" w="1200x" alt="..." >}}` shortcode. Place images in same directory as `_index.md`. Always include meaningful alt text.
- **Theme**: Prefer `layouts/**` overrides and `assets/custom.css` over editing `themes/paper/**`.

## Tooling / agent behavior

- Prefer using **absolute paths** when calling tools (this workspace runs on macOS).
- When making changes, keep diffs minimal and consistent with existing style.
- Never introduce secrets; don't add external network dependencies unless the user asks.
